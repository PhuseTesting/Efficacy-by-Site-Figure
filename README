I created this empty file in Windows Git, then did a push to get it from my local pc to Github. So, the first version was empty, and now the second version has this first paragraph. I will commit the change, then try to edit it again and paste in the commands I used. Those commands were taken verbatim from the github screens, I will try to paste and explain what was done.
